# **Understanding Cyber Threats: Exploring Nessus and Beyond Scanning Tools**  
### **Category:** Cyber Security  

## **1. Introduction**  
In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, targeting organizations, businesses, and individuals. To mitigate these risks, **vulnerability assessment** plays a crucial role in identifying and addressing security weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.  

This project, **"Understanding Cyber Threats: Exploring Nessus and Beyond Scanning Tools,"** focuses on leveraging **Nessus**, a leading vulnerability scanning tool, to analyze system vulnerabilities. Additionally, we compare Nessus with other scanning tools and explore best practices for proactive cybersecurity.  

---

## **2. Objectives**  
The primary goals of this project are:  
âœ… Understanding **cyber threats** and vulnerabilities affecting systems, networks, and applications.  
âœ… Performing **hands-on vulnerability scanning** using **Nessus**.  
âœ… Exploring alternative scanning tools like **OpenVAS, Qualys, and Nexpose**.  
âœ… Comparing the effectiveness and detection capabilities of different vulnerability assessment tools.  
âœ… Providing **best practices** for addressing vulnerabilities and improving security posture.

## **3. Tools & Technologies Used**  
ðŸ”¹ **Kali Linux** â€“ Security testing platform  
ðŸ”¹ **Nessus** â€“ Vulnerability scanning tool  
ðŸ”¹ **Metasploitable 2** â€“ A deliberately vulnerable virtual machine  
ðŸ”¹ **VirtualBox** â€“ Virtualization platform to run Metasploitable 2  
ðŸ”¹ **Metasploit Framework** â€“ For exploitation and testing security flaws

## **4. Project Execution**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Setting Up the Environment**  
1. Installed **Kali Linux** and ensured it was updated.  
2. Installed **Nessus** on Kali Linux and activated it.  
3. Downloaded and configured **Metasploitable 2** in VirtualBox.  
4. Found the IP address of Metasploitable 2 (`ifconfig`).  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Performing Vulnerability Assessment with Nessus**  
1. **Started Nessus service** (`sudo systemctl start nessusd`).  
2. Accessed Nessus via **`https://localhost:8834`**.  
3. Created a **new scan** in Nessus:  
   - **Scan Type**: Basic Network Scan  
   - **Target**: Metasploitable 2 IP (`192.168.72.129`)  
4. Ran the scan and **analyzed vulnerabilities**:  
   - **Critical & High vulnerabilities** were identified.  
   - **Risk ratings, exploitability, and mitigation recommendations** were reviewed.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Exploiting Vulnerabilities Using Metasploit**  
1. Used **Metasploit Framework** to test identified vulnerabilities.  
2. Successfully exploited **known vulnerabilities** (e.g., misconfigured services).  
3. Demonstrated **privilege escalation and remote code execution**.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Comparing Nessus with Other Tools**  
1. Compared Nessus results with **OpenVAS, Qualys, and Nexpose**.  
2. Analyzed differences in **scanning speed, accuracy, and reporting features**.  

---

## **5. Results & Findings**  
ðŸ“Œ **Key vulnerabilities found**:  
- **Outdated software versions** (e.g., Apache, MySQL, OpenSSH).  
- **Default credentials** (e.g., `msfadmin/msfadmin`).  
- **Open ports & misconfigured services** (FTP, Telnet, SMB).  
- **Privilege escalation possibilities**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Comparison of Nessus vs. OpenVAS, Qualys, Nexpose**:  
| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses |  
|------|----------|------------|  
| **Nessus** | Highly detailed reports, strong vulnerability detection | Paid version required for advanced features |  
| **OpenVAS** | Free & open-source, good for penetration testing | Slower scan times |  
| **Qualys** | Cloud-based, strong compliance reports | Requires enterprise subscription |  
| **Nexpose** | Integrated with Metasploit, real-time threat updates | Requires significant system resources |  

---

## **6. Conclusion & Best Practices**  
âœ… Regularly update and patch systems to mitigate vulnerabilities.  
âœ… Disable unnecessary services and **use strong authentication** methods.  
âœ… Conduct **regular vulnerability scans** using Nessus or alternative tools.  
âœ… Implement **firewalls and intrusion detection systems** (IDS).  
âœ… Follow **cyber hygiene** best practices to reduce security risks.  

---

## **7. Future Enhancements**  
ðŸ”¹ Automating vulnerability scanning with **cron jobs**.  
ðŸ”¹ Integrating Nessus with **SIEM tools** for real-time threat monitoring.  
ðŸ”¹ Using **AI-driven threat intelligence** for proactive security measures.
